# Decapitator
This is a WIP tool for running Raspberry Pi's (and other Linux machines) in headless mode. It will report to you it's IP address on boot making it easier to SSH in. This tool is currently working and stable, however this readme doesn't yet provide a full explanation of use (duh), but if you just run 'sudo python3 init.py' it should be reasonably self-explanatory.
